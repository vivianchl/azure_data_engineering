# End to End Azure Data Engineering Project

This project is the first hands-on pratice for Data Engineering. The purpose is to develop an end-to-end data solution by ingesting tables from an on-premise SQL Server database using Azure Data Factory. The data is then stored in Azure Data Lake. Azure Databricks is used to process and transform the raw data into its cleanest form, which is subsequently loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics. Finally, Microsoft Power BI is integrated with Azure Synapse Analytics to create an interactive dashboard. For monitoring and governance, Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault are implemented.

The tools that are used in this project are:

* Azure Data Factory (Data Ingestion)
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (Data Storage)
* Azure Databricks (Data Transformation)
* Azure Synapse Analytics
* Azure Key vault
* Azure Active Directory (AAD) and
* Microsoft Power BI
