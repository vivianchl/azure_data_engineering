# End to End Azure Data Engineering Project

This project is the hands-on pratice for Data Engineering with MS Azure. The purpose is to develop an solution by ingesting tables from an collected data using Azure Data Factory. The data is then stored in Azure Data Lake. Azure Databricks is used to process and transform the raw data into its cleanest form, which is subsequently loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics.

The project aims to gain the first overview with Azure data engineering workflow. Therefore, the data transformation part only including the very basic exploratory.

The tools that are used in this project are:

* Azure Data Factory (Data Ingestion)
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (Data Storage)
* Azure Databricks (Data Transformation)
* Azure Synapse Analytics (Data Analysis)

The data consists of athletes, coaches, entriesgender, medals and teams from Tokyo Olympic Data which is downloaded from kaggle.
